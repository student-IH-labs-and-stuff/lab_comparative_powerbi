# Lab | Comparative report with PowerBi

Refer to the same data source from the previous lab [Marketing_Customer_Analysis](https://github.com/KofiSika/Testing_eye/blob/main/Labs/Data_Analytics_with_PowerBi/Files_for_Lab/Marketing_Customer_Analysis.txt) for this lab

### Instructions 
1. Create a new column called Client_Rating and group customers into Low, Medium or High based on their Monthly_Premium: 
    * Monthly premium less than 70 is Low 
    * Monthly premium greater than 150 is High 
    * Monthly premium between 70 and 150 is Medium 

2. Now that we have classified clients by their monthly premium let's create a one page report depicting the following information: 
    * How many clients fall under each Client_rating and what is the average Customer Lifetime Value of each rating group ? 
    * Show average total claim by client rating and is there a contrast between number of clients in rating and total claim amount ? 
3. On the same page create a chart (Tip: Use a matrix (crosstab) or maps) showing clients with only a High school diploma or below and have a customer lifetime value greater than 2000, how many clients fall in this category and what states are they from ? 
4. Use the card feature to show the total number of clients on the same report page and tidy up your report to remove clutter and edit titles accordingly.
