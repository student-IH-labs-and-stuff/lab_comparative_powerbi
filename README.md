# Lab | Comparative report with PowerBi

Refer to the same data source from the previous lab [Marketing_Customer_Analysis](https://github.com/student-IH-labs-and-stuff/lab_comparative_powerbi/tree/main/files_for_lab) for this lab

### Instructions 
1. Create a new column called Client_Rating and group customers into Low, Medium or High based on their Monthly_Premium: 
    * Monthly premium less than 70 is Low 
    * Monthly premium greater than 150 is High 
    * Monthly premium between 70 and 150 is Medium 

2. Now that we have classified clients by their monthly premium let's create a one page report depicting the following information: 
    * How many clients fall under each Client_rating and what is the average Customer Lifetime Value of each rating group ? 
    * Show average total claim by client rating and is there a contrast between number of clients in rating and total claim amount ? 
3. Include a chart on a different topic: on the same report page create a chart (Tip: Use a matrix (crosstab) or map) showing those clients with only a High school diploma or below and who have a customer lifetime value greater than 2000. How many clients fall in this category and which States are they from ? 
4. Use the card feature to show the total number of clients on the same report page and tidy up your report to remove any visual clutter,  edit and format chart titles so that the report is easy to use and navigate. 
5. Test your report to ensure expected interactivity works - ideally the summary card will update when you click on the other charts.
