# Lab | Comparative report with PowerBi

Refer to the same data source from the previous lab [Marketing_Customer_Analysis.csv](https://github.com/KofiSika/Testing_eye/blob/main/Labs/Data_Analytics_with_PowerBi/Files_for_Lab/Marketing_Customer_Analysis.txt) for this lab

### Instructions 
1. Create a new column called Client_Rating and group customers into Low, Medium or High based on their Monthly_Premium: 
    * Monthly premium less than 70 is Low 
    * Monthly premium greater than 150 is High 
    * Monthly premium between 70 and 150 is Medium 

2. Create first chart in this report : How many clients fall under each Client_rating and what is the average Customer Lifetime Value of each rating group ? (Use appropriate chart and tool tips)
3. Staying on the same page in PowerBI, create a quick measure of clients with only a High school diploma or below and have customer lifetime value greater than 2000. Create a second chart pn this page which shows how many clients fall in this category and what states are they from  (Tip: Use a matrix (crosstab) or maps) 
4. Use a filter across both reports (whole page) to show number of clients that have an income of 0. 
5. Ensure the two charts have been given enough space on the report before testing it to ensure the filter, tooltips and plots are working as expected.
